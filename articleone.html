        <p>As chaos in Kabul continues amid Afghanistan‘s mass evacuations, the Taliban‘s rapid takeover and a suicide
            bombing that left more than 180 dead — including American soldiers — all eyes are on the U.S. now that the
            deadline for their final military withdrawal rapidly approaches.
            The Taliban had moved with surprising speed in the months after U.S. President Joe Biden announced the
            withdrawal of the remaining American troops from the country. A key turning point came when a contingent of
            U.S. troops emptied a major base — the militant group swept through and effectively conquered the majority
            of Afghanistan — including its capital — within weeks.
            Islamist group’s brutal reign of the country from 1996 to 2001 included stoning adulterers and banning
            women from working outside their homes or attending school, until they were pushed back by U.S.-led
            coalition forces hunting down elements of al-Qaeda that were being sheltered.Fears over possible reprisals on Afghans that helped coalition forces have prompted a mass exodus in recent
            weeks. Other Afghan civilians, including officials, journalists, activists and minority groups, have also
            been prompted to leave.

            Here’s a look at the lead-up to the Taliban’s takeover of the country, and what’s happened in efforts to
            evacuate refugees so far.

            Feb. 29, 2020: American and Taliban diplomats sign a peace agreement in Doha, Qatar, which saw an agreement
            for a U.S. withdrawal of troops and for the Taliban to stop attacks on Americans.

            Later that year in September, Taliban-Afghan government talks would begin, though no progress or agreements
            would be made.

            April 14, 2021: Biden announces the withdrawal of America’s remaining troops in Afghanistan by Sept. 11, the
            20th anniversary of al-Qaeda’s terrorist attacks on the United States.

            May 2021- July 2021: The Taliban start making gains across several key districts and territories across
            Afghanistan. Kabul remains untouched and under government control for now.

            July 2, 2021: U.S. forces vacate its largest airbase in the country — Bagram Air Field — after nearly 20
            years. The base is handed over to Afghan security forces, though there is some confusion with the
            transition.
            On the same day, the Pentagon said America’s final withdrawal could be completed by the end of August —
            earlier than Biden’s instructions to wind down by Sept. 11.</p>

            July 8, 2021: Canadian government sources tell Reuters of plans to take in Afghan interpreters and their
            families amid the U.S. pullout.

        Canada’s military involvement in Afghanistan has been limited for seven years, after the last active
            Canadian troops left in 2014.

        July 14, 2021: U.S. officials unveil plans to evacuate some Afghan military helpers that assisted its troops
            in the region.

        July 17, 2021: Canadian officials, including Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino, confirm plans to help
            Afghans that have worked with Canada, though they give no clear timeline or further details of the
            undertaking.

        In the coming days, the Afghan interpreters Canada had pledged to assist say that the Immigration department
            is failing to resettle them and their families. Advocates decry a slow and difficult documentation process.
            July 23, 2021: The federal government unveil a new “path to protection” for Afghans who supported Canadian
            troops in order to resettle them along with their families.

            The Inbox for those Afghans to apply to resettle would later crash after the government backed off from an
            initial 72-hour application timeline.

            The Inbox for those Afghans to apply to resettle would later crash after the government backed off from an

            Aug. 15, 2021: The Taliban begins entry of Kabul, prompting President Ghani to flee alongside a number of
            officials.

            The insurgent group claims the Afghanistan “war is over,” with them having essentially complete control of
            the country following their storming of the capital.

            Canada temporarily suspends diplomatic relations with the country that same day.

            Aug. 16, 2021: Evacuation flights coming out of Kabul’s Hamid Karzai Airport are suspended after at least
            five people were killed.

            Images circulate showing refugees clinging to a U.S. military aircraft as it took off, with reports of two
            people falling to their deaths. </p>

            Aug. 17, 2021: Evacuation flights resume out of Kabul, with U.S. forces taking charge of the airport. The
            Taliban maintain control of all other ground routes in the city.
            In an apparent act of moderation, the Taliban declared “amnesty” for all those across the country and asked
            women to join their government.
            Two more flights arrive in Canada carrying Afghan refugees and diplomatic staff. Trudeau reiterates that
            Canada had “no plans” to officially recognize the Taliban as the country’s government.
            Aug. 18, 2021: Biden pledges to evacuate all American citizens from the country, and said that U.S. soldiers
            would stay until they had all left.
            Canada reaches a deal for two military planes to resume flying regularly to evacuate people from Kabul’s
            airport.
            The Taliban would kill at least one person and injure six more after quashing a protest in Jalalabad, near
            the border of Pakistan.
            Aug. 20, 2021: Reports of targeted killings in Taliban-controlled areas fuel the exodus of thousands more
            refugees to Kabul’s airport.
            Biden reassures Americans still in Kabul that the U.S. would get them home, while Canadian officials begin
            to waive passport and COVID-19 testing requirements for Afghan refugees.
            Aug. 23, 2021: U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he will convene the G7 for emergency talks on
            Afghanistan.
            Biden also confirms that he would not rule out extending the Aug. 31 deadline set prior to the Taliban’s
            takeover.
            Several Canadian, U.S. and other foreign agencies said they were purging content from their websites in
            order to protect Afghans.
            Aug. 24, 2021: Trudeau announces that Canada would be “ready to stay” past the Aug. 31 deadline, set by the
            U.S. However, Biden would later double-down on the end-of-month evacuation date.
            The U.N. reports evidence of violations committed by the Taliban, including “summary executions” of
            civilians and Afghan forces who had surrendered.
            Aug. 25, 2021: Poland and Belgium end their Afghanistan evacuations.
            Aug. 26, 2021: Reports emerge of two blasts near the entrance of Kabul’s airport.
            Officials would later reveal that the explosions had killed 12 members of the U.S. military and injured
            another 15 — the first troops to be killed in action there in 18 months.
            At least 60 Afghan civilians were reported killed and another 140 injured by end of the day.

            There were no reports of Canadians being harmed, according to Global Affairs Canada.

            U.S. military officials placed the blame on ISIS Khorosan, otherwise known as ISIS-K — an offshoot of the
            Islamic State operating in Afghanistan. The group would later claim responsibility for the suicide bombing.

            In a briefing, Biden pledged to hunt down those responsible.

            Canadian officials also officially ended the country’s evacuation efforts, despite some Canadians still
            being stuck in the Taliban-run country.

            Roughly 3,700 people were evacuated during the operation, according to Gen. Wayne Eyre.

            Aug. 27, 2021: The death toll from the blast rises to more than 180 people — 169 Afghans and 13 U.S. service
            members in total, according to officials.

            Canadian officials also said they had secured 500 seats on a U.S. flight from Kabul to pull out citizens and
            refugees it had left behind.

            The U.S. military said it had used a drone strike to kill an ISIS-K member believed to be “behind the
            planning of the bombing.”
