            Allah but he put the words
            together. The quran is a word chosen from Allah. “I divided the prayer in two halves between myself and my
            slaves” the rest of the hadith starts with the fatiha. And then he says that when the slave says
            alhamdulillah Allah says my slave has just praised me. So we will start with after bismillah.(There is a
            major difference in opinions within the schools of thought).

        <p class="padding" id="vue-p">Alhamdulilah means praise and thanks belongs to Allah. Nouman ali khan puts two
            words together,
            Madih(praise)
            and shukur(thanks) to communicate this.
            Madih can be false, it can also be done to living and nonliving
            things. Hamd(praise) is only done for the living, hamd has to be sincere. You say thank you when someone
            does
            something to you. In thanks you had to recognize something for you has been done. Gratitude is a reaction,
            hamd isn't a reaction. Hamd is independent. How come Allah didnt say "Praise Allah", it then becomes a order
            from god, with an order there are two options, either they do it or they don't.
            The ball isn't in your court, it's in the other person's court. If Allah said praise Allah that means we are
            responsible. But Allah didn't say that because that would make it dependent on us whether we gave him praise
            or not.</p>

        <p class="padding" id="backend-p"> We are now on rab. Which has five meanings from what I know(The owner, the
            one in charge, the caretaker, the
            giver of gifts, the one who makes sure it does not die, or the maintainer), but the main meaning is master.
            A master that has those qualities. This is now talking about the relationship that we have with Allah. For
            example, in marriage there are two parties, husband and wife, in class there are two parties, teacher and
            students. So if Allah is master we are slave. If he is caretaker we are the ones being taken care of and so
            on with the other meanings.

        <div>
            <p id="carti">
                The word rab is the beginning of our relationship with Allah. The entire quran
                fundamentally revolves around the idea that accept Allah as master and accept yourself as slave. What
                Allah
                does
                with his property is up to him and it is justified. Because we are property to him. No master let you
                keep
                going with mistakes, worst case they’ll punish but at the best case they’ll remove your privileges. But
                even
                as we keep sinning and keep making mistakes against our master he still continues to give his gifts and
                blessings. A master is also not an employer. The point Nouman is giving is that we are slaves every
                hour of our days. Once you're employed you only do the certain things you are told to do for your shift.
                Meaning that when you're done with your shift you don't have to do
                anything they tell you too. Also you only do what you're employed for if you're an accountant the
                employer
                can't tell you to wash the window. Contrary to that a master can ask for anything
                from a slave and the slave has to abide regardless of what the master asks.

        <p class="padding" id="outro"> Second Ayah. Rough translation is the most graceful, the most merciful. Both of
            these mean the most
            merciful. Mercy in the arab language means your taken care of in every angle. When two words in arabic are
            put next to each other they mean two different things. What makes these different? In Ar-rahman by
            definition
            it's something extreme. It has three qualities, extreme mercy, mercy
            taking place right now. Just because you call someone merciful does not mean your being merciful at that
            moment. Ar-rahman
            means that this person is being extremely merciful right now. The next one is transience. Meaning it is
            temporary. But you may do something that will take away his mercy. May Allah protect us from that ameen.</p>

        <p id="pop">
            The two qualities of Ar-raheem is that it is permanent, and is not necessarily happening right now. If i say
            a person is strong that does not mean they are using their strength right now. But that does not diminish
            their strength just cause they are not using it at that moment. But before we said Ar-raheem is not always
            permanent. But now this word says it is permanent. These two definitions cover Ar-rahman in what it is
            missing when talking about Allah’s mercy. Ar-rahman said it is not permanent and Ar-raheem said it is,
            Ar-rahman said it is happening at all times and Ar-raheem said it is not necessarily happening right now.
            All possible angles of mercy are being covered by these two words.
        </p>

        <p id="poppy">
            Ar-rahman and Ar-raheem cover the immediate and the future. Nouman gave the analogy of an employee living
            paycheck to paycheck. And he is waiting for his boss to give the money to him but he needs it by 5:00 and it
            is 4:45. Another employee sees him stressing and says don't stress he is reliable. The employee replies I
            know he is reliable. I just wish he was being reliable right now. But as soon as the employee gets his
            paycheck and pays for all of which he is responsible for he begins to start worrying about the future and
            what's to come. Allah said Ar-rahman first one of the three qualities was that it is happening right now.
            The employee who got the paycheck from his boss and handled his responsibilities begins to plan and worry
            about the future to see if he’ll be able to sustain those responsibilities. One of Ar-raheem qualities was
            that it is not necessarily happening right now. Meaning that Allah’s mercy may not be happening right now
            but that does not mean because it is not happening right now it will not happen later. This covers the
            future.
            Similar to how an employee living paycheck to paycheck may not be getting ready to pay this month's rent
            does not mean he does not have the capability to do so.

        <div>
            <p id="ayah-three">The owner/king of the day of judgment. There are two ways the say malik and the two
                different ways have
                two
                different meanings. King and owner. On the day of judgment everything will be taken into account. You
                don't
                call yourself a king over something small, but you'll call yourself the owner of something
                small. Ex I’ll call myself the owner of this water bottle not the king, and if I was the king of a
                nation I
                wouldn't call myself the owner of the nation but the king. So in terms of the day of judgment both big
                and
                small things are going to be accounted for so Allah is both owner and king, covering both big and small.
                Allah said he is the owner of the DAY of judgment, not just judgment. So why did Allah call himself the
                owner of that day. An analogy is given by Nouman, he says, if I have a bag and I say i'm the owner of
                this
                bag, that would mean that I also own the contents inside this bag logically. If Allah says he is the
                owner
                of that day it means that since he owns the day as well everything that happens within that day.</p>

        <div>
            <p id="ayah-four">In this ayah we declare that we are going to enslave ourselves to Allah because of the
                first ayah regarding
                rab, him being the caretaker, master, the one keeping us alive and so on. If that is not enough then it
                is
                because he is Ar-rahman, and if that isn't enough it is because he is Ar-Raheem, and if that is not
                enough
                then be wary because he is the malik of the day of judgment. And in this ayah we declare submission. In
                this
                ayah it is phrased as if we are talking to him not about him. Allah begins fatiha by telling himself
                about
                us and then now we begin to reply back as if we are conversing with Allah. In doing this we enslave
                ourselves to Allah. Nouman goes on to talk about how when we do this it is a declaration of complete
                dependence on Allah, and in doing that we truly become free. Either people are enslaved to creation or a
                creator and once you enslave yourself to creation you've taken upon an imperfect finite master. All
                human
                beings are slaves to something but we have the free will to choose what we wish to enslave ourselves to
                and
                in this ayah we choose Allah swt.</p>
            <p id="mk"> 
                In doing this we gain independence from everything else, those who do
                not
                take upon Allah as they’re master are enslaved to multiple other masters such as desires, temptations,
                ideologies, family, peer pressure, culture etc. This ayah means only you who we worship and
                enslaves ourselves to. In this ayah iyakanastaeen means we are asking Allah for help. This word is
                defined
                as
                asking for help when you're struggling on something that you’ve already attempted and tried. Ibrahim As
                was
                thrown into the fire first and then it became cool, the muslims went to the battle of Badr and then the
                angels helped them. So do not ask for help if you haven’t tried. So you best not be lying to Allah when
                you
                stand in front of Allah and read this ayah, because with this you’ve claimed that you already made the
                effort, and claiming that
                you're struggling and you're the only one who I will turn to. If it is time to pray one of the daily
                prayers
                and you are rushing to finishing the salah,
                you stand in front of Allah and say I’m trying so hard Allah to be your slave
                just help me I’m putting in the effort, that would be a lie to not only yourself but Allah as well. A
                major
                insult to Allah. What Allah wants is primary what we want is secondary that is why we
                declare our dependence and ourselves to Allah and then ask for help. Which is why the format of this
                ayah
                was worded with what we owe Allah first and then what we want from Allah second. In the ayah we did not
                say
                what we need help with. There are a multitude of reasons why Allah did not put it in there for us but
                Nouman
                gives 3. The first one is that Allah already knows what you need help with. The second one is the list
                can
                be so long that you just say “help”, and the third thing is you're really desperate so you just cry out
                for
                help.

            <p id="ayah-five">When we ask for help we need to specify what kind of help we want and that is what this
                ayah is specifying,
                Allah is telling us that if we ask for this kind of help this will then cover all the other things we
                need
                help with and that is guidance.
                Now with surah Fatiha we read this chapter every
                single day 17 times a day mandatory not optional. This would mean we ask for guidance over and over
                again.
                If someone is dying of thirst and asks someone for water, and he does not receive the water he's going
                to
                ask again and again because he’s desperate. The one who asks for something over and over again is
                desperate,
                and we ask for guidance between rakats. The person who asks is also the one in need. So we both need and
                are
                extremely desperate for Allah’s guidance.</p>

            <p id="ayah-six">In this ayah we are asking Allah to make us of a certain group of people.
                The first half of is speaking of wanting to be with
                those who are favoured and the second half is us asking Allah not to make us of those who received
                anger.
                When we are asking for favour from Allah he is mentioned, but in
                the other half Allah is not mentioned. The second half is us asking Allah to not make us upon those who
                you've hurled your anger upon. Allah is so angry at them he does not even want to be mentioned with
                them. A verb was used in the first half of this ayah, and a noun was used in the later half of this
                ayah.
                When using a verb
                it is not always there, but using a noun implies that it is always there. Meaning that the people that
                we
                should look out for are always going to be there(the ones who have got Allah's anger hurled upon them),
                and
                the people who have recieved Allah's favour will not alway be there. When doing wrong there are two
                types of
                people, people who
                know better and those who didn't know better. In the second half of the ayah these two types of people
                are
                described, adDaleen is those who didn't know, and maqdoobi is those who did. Regardless both will still
                get
                a punishment for it. Ignorance is not a justifiable plea of innocence. So we ask Allah to not make us of
                those who knew better or did not know ameen.</p>
